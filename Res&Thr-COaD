Response Time - How long does it take to get the task done.

Performence Time - 1/Execution Time. Meaning, The opposite of performence.

If A is n times faster than B:
                                Performence of X / Performence of Y   ==   Execution of Y / Execution of X   ==   n.

Example:
        It takes 10s for A and 15s for B to complete.
        
        so 15s/10s == 1.5s  ==>  A is 1.5 faster than B
