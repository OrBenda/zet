How does the functions cos/sin defined?

We draw the unit circle around (0,0)
  Let a be an angle.
    The point that meets the unit circle with the angle a is (cos(a), sin(a))

SO:
    if a = 0: cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0
    
    if a = pi/2: cos(pi/2) = 0, sin(pi/2) = 1

In a more intuitive way, for some angle a, cos(a) is the X value and sin(a) is the Y value.
