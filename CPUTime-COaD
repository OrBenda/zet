How can one know how to compute CPU Time?

If you got 2 items of data:
                            1. We know how many CPU Clock cycles there is
                            2. We know how long it takes for each Clock Cycle takes
                            
==> CPU Time = CPU Clock cycles * Clock Cycle Time  ==  CPU Clock cycles / Clock rate


Sometimes its more convienient to multiply CPU CC with CCT, and sometimes its better to divide CPU CC to Clock rate
